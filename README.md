# User Management App

This project is a simple user management application built using React. It allows users to view, add, edit, and delete users fetched from an API. The app also uses Tailwind CSS for styling, making the design responsive and modern.

## Features

- **View Users**: The app fetches and displays a list of users from a mock API (`jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`).
- **Add Users**: Users can be added with basic details like name, email, and department.
- **Edit Users**: Existing users can be edited and updated.
- **Delete Users**: Users can be deleted from the list.
- **Loading State**: A loading indicator is shown while the user data is being fetched from the API.

## Technologies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the application.
- **JSONPlaceholder API**: A mock API for simulating user data fetching.
